## Project Motivation
This is the first of several Udacity projects in the Data Science Nano-degree program. The primary aim of this project 
is therefore to complete the course-work of the mentioned program. 

The secondary aim of this project was to answer the 4 business questions related to AirBnB Seattle listings:
1. Does becoming a verified host positively impact your monthly income or occupancy rate in Seattle?
1. Does becoming a Super-Host positively impact your monthly income or occupancy rate in Seattle?
1. Does proximity to competition negatively impact your monthly income?
1. What factors should influence the rate you set for your listing?
