# Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services
## Installation
Run the following command to set up the environment for this project. 

```
conda create --name project_4_udacity python==3.7.3 && conda activate project_4_udacity && conda install pandas jupyterlab altair "pandas-profiling>2.0" pytest scikit-learn lightgbm hdbscan shap umap-learn imbalanced-learn
```

## Project Motivation
This is the first of several Udacity projects in the Data Science Nano-degree program. The primary aim of this project 
is therefore to complete the course-work of the mentioned program. 

The secondary aim of this project is 2 pronged:
1. To create a Customer Segmentation report for Arvato Financial Services
1. To build a Supervised model that gives us the probability of an individual becoming a customer to Arvato's client.

## File Descriptions
This project is has 2 primary folders: 
- **data** : Data Folder. It contains 2 folders
    - **processed**: Output of the analysis
    - **raw**: The raw data provided by Udacity
- **src**: Source code folder. It contains 3 files:
    - **Arvato Project Workbook**: Jupyter notebook template provided by Udacity. It is unused.
    - **Customer Segmentation Analysis**: Jupyter notebook/HTML where Part 1 of the analysis was performed.
    - **Supervised Learning Model**: Jupyter notebook/HTML where Part 2 of the analysis was performed.

## How to Interact with Project
To interact with the project, take the following steps:
1. Activate the _project_4_udacity_ environment on the Anaconda console
1. Navigate to the directory of the project on the Anaconda Console
1. Start up Jupyter Lab using the command `jupyter lab`
1. Open the Analysis notebook from the jupyter notebook page

## Results Summary
In summary:
1. The full Customer Segmentation report can be found [here]()
1. The resultant Supervised Model performed well. It achieved an **AUC of 0.767** as shown below:
